# PROJECT-6
EMSONET

Step 1

Generate the ILD masks for the target and masker using the Pre-trained model SONET (given in this repository as 6 files gregnet15.mat to gregnet90.mat according to the separation angle between source and masker).

Step2

Generates the IPD masks for taget  and masker using Expectation Maximization Algorithm.

Step 3

Combine the ILD and IPD masks to generate estimated sources and evaluate them against clean sources.
